## Social media doesn't have to be so 2 dimensional.
It's easy to get caught up in meaningless doomscrolling, spending hours doing nothing but sitting and scrolling through a feed of information that will never be relevant to our lives. Social media should not be this way, social media has the power to educate people and get them involved in their communities, thus we decided to create a new form of social media which focuses on local community interaction.

## So What is IntARNet?
IntARnet is an AR social media where posts are drawings, texts, and 3D models placed around the world by users. In order to view a post, a user must walk to it as all posts have a geospatial anchor tying it to a physical location in the world. This means content the user will see will almost always likely be relevant to them as content must be created physically placed in the world by people in their community. In addition to this, doomscrolling is difficult as users must go walk outside to see posts, encouraging a more active lifestyle.

## How Was It Made?
We used Unity3D with ARFoundation, ARKit, ARCore for the AR implementation
Google Poly
Art was created using Photoshop, Aseprite, and Figma

## Challenges We Ran Into
Azure :(

## Accomplishments that We're Proud Of
Developing a fully functional AR application with support for custom user content
An incredibly aesthetic user interface reminiscent of the late 90s

## What we learned
How to design for AR, 90s design style

## What's next for IntARnet
-Implementing Azure for geospatial anchors
-Implementing NFT for buying spaces as canvases or buying users' art
-Creating better tools for making posts
